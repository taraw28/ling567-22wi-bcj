# Lab 4
## Phenomena
### Questions
- polar interrogatives
  - using the interrogative particle _nganyji_. The particle usually appears first in the clause. This particle questions the proposition in the **clause as a whole**.
  - Ex(s) for a free question word _nganyji_ :
     ```
    Source: a:618
    Vetted: t
    Judgement: g
    Phenomena: q
    **Nganyji** mi-n-jala-gal jiy-irr ooldoobal
    NGANYJI 2-TR-see-REC.PST 2M.POSS-3A things
    `Did you see your things?’

    Source: a:618
    Vetted: t
    Judgement: g
    Phenomena: q
    Nganyji ngay ngankiida Broomengan?
    Nganyji ngay nga-n-k-iid-a Broome-ngan
    `Will I go to Broome?’

    Nganyji lol inyjiidigal jan mayar?
    Nganyji lol i-ny-jiidi-gal jan mayar
    INTERROG burn 3-PST-go-REC.PST 1MIN.POSS house
    `Did my house burn?’
    ```
  - There are some derivatives of nganyji, such as _nganyjal_ and _nganyjirrgoordoo_ ‘how many’ (and in the old texts, nganyjarda)._ Nganyjal_ is marked with the indefinite marker -al.
  - Ex(s):
    ```
    Nganyjal darr oonkara ngoorrij.
    Nganyjal darr oo-n-k-ar-a ngoorrij
    hopefully come 3-TR-FUT-pierce-FUT future
    `Hopefully he will come tomorrow.’

    Nganyjal irrgoordoo aalga ingarralanana namard.
    Nganyjal irrgoordoo aalga i-ng-arr-ala-na-na namard
    NGANYJAL how.much day 3-PST-AUG-live-CONT-REM.PST just
    `We don’t know how long they lived without fire.’
    ```

   - using clitic =_(g)arda_ which has a clear deontic meaning. It is probably related to the adverb _garda_, which means ‘still’ in the sense of ‘X still did something (even though I told him not to).’ This clitic interacts with **focus** and is used to question **particular constituents**. The clitic attaches to the item under interrogation. (It seems to have single word scope, e.g. aarlarda in the following would be ‘two FISH, or something else, like octopus?’)
    - Ex(s) for the clitic _(g)arda_
      ```

      1MIN=INT go Broome-ALL “or” 2MIN=INT
      `Will I go to Broome today or will it be you?’
      ```


    - using _=bard(a)_, also a clitic with identical distribution to _=gard_. It appears to have an epistemic function in interrogatives; that is, it questions an **individual constituent** and asks the question ‘was it this or something else?’
      ```

- content questions
  - interrogative placement and intonation:
     - asked with one of a number of interrogative pronounsinterrogative pronoun, usually first in the clause, receives intonational focus, with a H* tone; interrogative clauses have a sharp rise at the end of the clause, which may occur over a single syllable. Although the pronoun is usually first in the clause, it need not be, and examples of both _nganyji_ and _anggi_ are found which are non-initial, and which still have an interrogative reading.
     - Ex(s):
        ```
        Source: a:622
        Vetted: t

        where-ALL go 2-TR-do/say-CONT
        `Where are you going?’
        ```

  - Interrogative pronouns such as anggaba can modify nouns. That is, they can appear as pronominal modifiers within Noun Phrases.
    - Ex:
      ```
      Source: a:623
      Vetted: t

      Phenomena: wh

      [Anggaba-nim laanybiid] i-na-ng-gala-gal=jan ooldoobal
      ‘Which thief [lit. ‘who thief’] went off with my stuff?’
      ```

  - ‘Why’ questions:
    - _Angan_ ‘why’ asks about the **reason** for an action or event.
    - _anggi_ ‘what’ is used to ask about the **purpos**e of an action.
    - both are stance-neutral markers
    - Ex(s):
      ```
      Source: a:624
      Vetted: t
      Judgement: g
      Phenomena: wh

      Angan mi-ny-jarrala-gal joornk
      why 2-PST-run-REC.PST fast
      `Why did you run so fast?'
      ```

  - _goonban(kij)_ signals the speaker’s disapproval of an action and is usually translated as ‘why on earth’.
    - This interrogative adverb may be qualified with =_gija_ ‘very’
    - Ex(s):
      ```
      Source: a:625

      why.on.earth follow 3-TR-do/say-APPL=1A.DO
      `Why on earth does she have to follow us?’
      ```

- double interrogatives
  - More than one interrogative pronoun can appear in a clause. Multiple interrogatives are allowed, and there are few restrictions on the order, at least of argument interrogatives. The difference in meaning appears to depend on which interrogative has greater focus.
  - Ex(s):
    ```
    Source: a:625
    Vetted: t
    Judgement: g
    Phenomena: wh
    Anggabanim anggi inarligal?
    Anggaba-nim anggi i-na-rli-gal
    who-ERG what 3-TR-eat-REC.PST
    `Who ate what?’
    ```

  - When it comes to multiple interrogatives with both arguments and adjuncts, however, the judgments are different. This is one of the few places in the grammar where there are differences between free adjunct and argument phrases. For example, multiple interrogatives involving _janaboor_ ‘where’ are fine when the adjunct is fronted before _anggaba_ ‘who’, but only if the verb is final:
    ```
    Source: a:627
    Vetted: t
    Judgement: g
    Phenomena: wh
    Anggaba minjalagal janaboor?
    Anggaba mi-n-jala-gal janaboor

    `Who did you see where?’

    Phenomena: wh
    Janaboor anggaba minjalagal?

    `Who did you see where?’

    Judgement: g
    Phenomena: wh
    Nyanyjirrgoordoo aarli minjooloonggalirr baanigarr?
    Nyanyjirrgoordoo aarli mi-n-jooloong-gal=irr baanigarr?
    how.many fish 2M-TR-collect-REC.PST=3A.DO when
    `How many fish did you collect when?/When did you collect
    how many fish?’
    ```

### Argument Optionality
- Bardi has free argument omission (‘pro-drop’). It does allow subjects and objects to be dropped. Pronouns are not syntactically obligatory in the clause. They are not used for reference tracking.

- Even in cases of potentially ambiguous argument tracking, free NPs or pronouns are seldom used. The ambiguity is tolerated, though there is some assumption of argument continuity (that is, that subjects continue subjects and objects continue objects); however, likelihood and real world knowledge are used to infer who is doing what.

- In the following example argument continuity is inferred by the absence of free NPs or pronouns and the subject marking on the verb provides information about which participants. Context identifies the referent of the verb agreement. The following example contains no argument NPs or pronouns at all; the only NPs are place names or locations.
  ```

  Roowil i-ng-irr-i-nya-na Ngalngoorarra yoorr   i-ng-arr-a-ma-n   Balalbalalngarr daab  i-ng-irr-i-nya-n    goona goorrir-on

  ```
- Heads of relative clauses, for example, can be omitted. Both speech act participants can be omitted. Subjects and objects of gerunds can be omitted, even though they are not cross-referenced on the verb.


- No omission cases
  - However, there are contexts under which free noun phrases appear not to be omissible

  - Other evidence may come from speaker intuitions about arguments which are omitted and understood from context, versus cases where there are no arguments (that is, distinctions between sentences like ‘he’s eating [cake]’ and ‘*we put the table’).

  - Pronouns cannot be omitted if the argument is in focus. But if they are in special focus (Kiss 1998), they may also get reinforcement, such as with the exclamative _arra_:
    ```
    Arra  ngay bard arr  ngandan.
    Arra  ngay bard arr  nga-n-da-n
    INTERJ  1MIN away come 1-TRdo/say-CONT
    `Hey look! It’s ME coming.’

    Ngayoonim  ngananarri         malarr.
    Ngayoo-nim nga-na-na=rri      malarr
    1MIN-ERG 1-CONT-REM.PST=2M.DO wife
    `I gave you wives.’
    ```
  - The following show that the ergative differentiates subject from oblique; it is not omissible even when the semantic roles are clear from context.
    ```
    p. 465
    Inyjargijin ngaarri.
    I-ny-jargi=jin ngaarri-ø
    3-PST-fear=3MIN.IO devil-ABS
    `He was afraid of the devil.’
    *`The devil was afraid of him.’

    Maanka injoogal       gaara  noorroonim.

    black   3-[PST]-TR-do/say-REC.PST sand   fire-ERG
    `The ground got black from the fire.’
    ```

  - In some cases the presence or absence of overt nominal material appears to be grammatically constrained. In the following Bardi sentence the noun _oorany_ is not omissible:
    ```
    Jaarla   nganjalagal  *(oorany)  wiliwilon  inkalgal.
    Jaarla   nga-n-jala-gal  *(oorany)  wiliwil-on  i-n-kal-gal
    beach(ø-loc)  1M-TR-see-PST woman    fishing  3M-TR-visit-REC.PST
    `I saw a woman on the beach, she was fishing.’ / ‘I saw the woman fishing on the beach.’
    ```

  - Pronouns (or free nouns) which are part of a coordinated phrase cannot be omitted:
    ```
    p. 294
    Monty, Lionel agal ngayoo angarrjarrarra barda Broomengan.
    Monty, Lionel agal ngayoo a-ng-arr-jarrarra barda Broome-ngan
    M.     L.     and  1MIN   1-PST-AUG-get.up. away  B.-ALL
    `Monty, Lionel and I got up and went off to Broome.’
    ```

### Possessives
- oblique pronouns used in possession
  - free possessive forms
    - table 7.3 pp 302
- nouns
  - 5 ways in which possession is marked
    1. possessive pronoun (7.4)
        ```
        Ngajana bo inambijjan goorlil.
        Ngajana bo i-na-m-b-ij=jan goorlil.

        `He picked up our spears.'
        ```

    2. inalienable nouns that take possessive prefixes (7.5)
        - number of possessum not expressed
        - select number of inalienable nouns take possessive prefixes, others take regular possessive pronouns
          ```
          pp. 210
          Ngamarlang nganangajimgal.
          nga-marla-ng nga-na-ngajim-gal
          1M.POSS-hand-INS 1-TR-PST-hit-REC.PST

          man 3.POSS-name Ngoolmoongoolmoo
          `The man's name was Ngoolmoongoolmoo.'
          ```
    3. comitative case use for certain types of attributes
    4. possessive pronoun may be cliticized to the verb (alternates with free possessive pronoun)
        ```
        Ginyingginim injoogooloojan daanggoo
        Ginyinggi-nim i-n-joogooloo=jan daanggoo
        3MIN-ERG 3-TR-break=1M.POSS jaw
        `He broke my jaw.'

        2MIN-ERG 2M.POSS-3A woman’s.child 3-AUG-fear-CONT-3M.IO=1M.POSS woman’s.child
        `Your children are frightened of my children.'
        ```
    5. verb -laba- marks possession
      - possessive pronouns are marked for the number and person of both the possessor and the possessum
      - possessive pronoun can lose aug marking if possessum is non-individuated
