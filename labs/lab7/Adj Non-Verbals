For AP non-verbal predicates, no copula is present: 

According to Bowern, adjectives don't exist as a class, and adjectival non-verbal predicates involve complex predicates of a preverb and a light verb. 
Here is an example with rarrjin+ ‘be ashamed of’indicating with a third personal min (p.468).

#doesn't parse
Rarrjin inmanjarrngay.
Rarrjin i-n-ma-n=jarrngay
shame 3-TR-put-CONT=1M.DO
‘I’m ashamed of it.’

Another way to express adjectives, Bardi uses a "causal construction" with an ergative noun and a subject as the expriencer (p.268). 
For the causal construction to convey adjectival meaning, the Badi speaker would says "I want water. I am thirsty."

For sentence #15 `The dogs are hungry' the preverb "alig" (feel.bad) is used along with the light verb "-j-" (do.say) 
as well as making the adjective "hunger" take the ergative case:

#15 Adj 

#doesn't parse
Manyjalnim alig irroojij iila.
manyjal-nim alig i-rr-oo-j-ij iila 
hunger-ERG feel.bad 3-AUG-TR-do.say-PFV dog 
`The dogs are hungry.'

Preverbal adjectives combine with the light verb -ni- 'sit.do' in a complex predicate. This is where Bardi adjectives take on a stative meaning (p.608)

Niiwandi inin ngamarla.
Niiwandi i-ni-n nga-marla.
long 3-sit-CONT 1-hand/finger
‘My fingers are stretched out.’
