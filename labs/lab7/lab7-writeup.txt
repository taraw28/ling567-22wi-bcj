Non-Verbal Predicates Phenomenon

For NP non-verbal predicates, no copula is present:

  # does parse
  Jarri aamba galgarr.
  jarri aamba galgarr
  this man widower
  `This man is a widower.'

  # does parse
  Jarri aamba garnibina.
  jarri aamba garnibina
  this man murderer
  `This man's a murderer.'

Tense is not included in these sentences directly. Instead, tense would be based on the context of the surrounding sentences. The order of the subject and object is flexible. It has been noted that focus is often applied to the element in the first position of a clause (as seen above). However, this is not always the case:

  # does parse
  Jalnggoogoorr jana nyami.
  jalnggoogoorr jana nyami
  doctor.man 1M.POSS mother's.father
  `My grandfather was a doctorman.'

To implement this, we started with a basic example sentence:

  # does parse
  Iila aarli.
  iila aarli
  dog cat
  `The dog is the cat.'

Then, we added a non-branching non-headed phrase structure rule (noun-predicate-rule) to bardi.tdl and instantiated it in rules.tdl. This rule allows for a noun to become a VP and introduces the "_be_v_id_rel" relation.

  noun-predicate-rule := basic-unary-phrase & nocoord &
    [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD verb,
                          VAL [ COMPS < >,
                          SUBJ < [ LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX #arg1,
                                            CAT [ HEAD noun,
                                                  VAL.SPR < > ] ] ] > ] ],
              NON-LOCAL #nl ],
              C-CONT [ HOOK [ LTOP #ltop,
                              INDEX #index,
                              XARG #arg1 ],
                        RELS.LIST < arg12-ev-relation &
                            [ PRED "_be_v_id_rel",
                              LBL #ltop,
                              ARG0 #index,
                              ARG1 #arg1,
                              ARG2 #arg2 ] >,
                        HCONS.LIST < qeq & [ LARG #larg ] > ],
              ARGS < [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD noun,
                                              VAL.SPR cons ],
                                        CONT.HOOK [ INDEX #arg2,
                                                    LTOP #larg ]],
                                NON-LOCAL #nl ]] > ].

This allowed us to parse "The dog is the cat" as well as other similar sentences. We expected it to generate 2 sentences but it generated 4. The noun-pred-rule will take nouns uninflected for case but it shouldn't. We tried to constrain it to CASES abs with:

              ARGS < [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD noun & [ CASE abs ],
                                              VAL.SPR cons ],
                                        CONT.HOOK [ INDEX #arg2,
                                                    LTOP #larg ]],
                                NON-LOCAL #nl ]] > ].

but this did not work. Our case position class is obligatory and the absolutive case is null marked so we are not entirely sure why this is happening or how to fix it.

- Bardi has nominal and adjectival predicates, and the copula is normally null (pp.601-610).
- Adjectives do not really exist independent of stative verbs.
- There is no PP either, and NPs are used with a locative verb.
- Locative case is frequently used to indicate 'static location.'
- The light verb -ni- ‘sit’ is used to indicate states;
for instance: iilan -ni- ‘be sick’; miyala -ni- ‘be awake’ (p. 538)
- Adjectival preverbs which form stative predicates with -ni- ‘sit’ may also
combine with the light verb -joo- ‘do/say’ to form inchoatives.

Below are the detailed ways non-verbal predicates are constructed:

Null Predicates:
- The presence of copula is independent of tense and can remain null for all tenses
- Order of subject and predicate is flexible
- Oblique pronouns (in the predicate) used along with a location case-marked noun in the subject can make copula predicates too.

Example [doesn’t parse] (p.601):
Ginyinggi aamba galgarr.
This man widower
`This man is a widower.’

arri aamba garnibina.
jarri aamba garnibina
this man murderer
`This man's a murderer.'

Jalnggoogoorr jana nyami.
jalnggoogoorr jana nyami
doctor.man 1M.POSS mother's.father
`My grandfather was a doctorman.'

- preference for predicates to be possessed when describing qualities (pp. 604)

Aman jina laya.
aman jina laya
little 3MIN.POSS fat
`It's got a little bit of fat.'

Niimana jina lagoorr.
many 3MIN.POSS egg
`It's got a lot of eggs.'

- nominal predicates can take the predicate marker -a (pp. 340)
(maybe make boorrboorriid = dancer for purpose of parsing)

Jarr aamba boorrboorriida.
jarr aamba boorrboorr-iid-a
this man dance-EXP-PRED
`This man's a dancer.'

- plural can be marked on predicate even if not verb (pp. 173)

#17
Irr iila irr aarli.
irr iila irr aarli
3AUG dog 3AUG cat
`The dogs are the cats.'

- no copula refers to permanent state

Niiwandi ngamarlangay.
niiwanda nga-marla-ngay
long 1-hand.or.finger-1MIN
`My fingers are long.'

Clauses with -ni- ‘sit’:

- Combining the verb -ni- ‘sit’ in dfferent ways with predicative adjectives can be used as copula.

Example [doesn't parse] (p. 554)
garrja -ni- ‘be sharp’:
garrja i-ni-n ginyinggi jamooyoon.
sharp 3-sit-CONT 3MIN knife
`The knife is sharp'

Location
- providing “spatial” information and stative readings
translated to ‘there was + noun + location/place (over there, in his camp)’

Inin baaloon.
i-ni-n baal-oon
3-be-CONT boughshed-LOC
`It's in the boughshed.'

- Some nouns take the locative suffix while others don't. For example, gardin 'cave' does take the suffix but jaala 'beach' doesn't.

Iilanim gardinon irrni.
iila-nim gardin-on i-rr-ni
dog-ERG cave-LOC 3-AUG-be
`The dogs are in the cave.'

Iilanim jaala irrni.
iila-nim jaala i-rr-ni
dog-ERG beach 3-AUG-be
`The dogs are at the beach.'

#16 (park = cave)
Iilanim gardinon irrni.
iila-nim gardin-on i-rr-ni
dog-ERG park-LOC 3-AUG-be
`The dogs are in the park.'

Aspectual modification of adjectives
- -ni- as a light verb used with an adjective creating syntactic minimal pairs
between sentences w/ complex predicate and those w/ null copula

- translated to copula as in ‘be + adjective’

Example [doesn't parse]
Garnka inin.
garnka i-ni-n
raw 3-sit-CONT
`It is raw.'

- copula refers to transient state

Niiwandi inin ngamarla.
niiwanda i-ni-n nga-marla
long 3-sit-CONT 1-hand.or.finger
`My fingers are stretched out.'

Elided Verbs:
- Verbs can only be seen elided in answers to questions having
a single noun phrase standing alone as the answer.

Example [doesn’t parse] (p.609):
Angginim goorr?
Anggi-nim goorr
what-ERG 2AUG
‘What’s wrong with you? What happened to you?’


Wh-Questions and Copula:
- To make constituent (wh-) questions, Bardi uses a number of interrogative pronouns that usually
appear clause initially. This analysis should work together with
the null-copula analysis of nominal non-verbal predicates.
- I beleive this could also be an "elided" verb way of constructing
non-verbal predicates explained above.

Below is an example, which doesn't parse:
Anggaba nyinga joo?
Anggaba nyi-nga joo
who 2MIN-name 2MIN
`What’s your name?'

TDL Changes
- In order to account for locative NPs:
 - added a non-branching rule to create PPs,
 - created a lexical rule for the NP constrained to be [CASE loc]
 - the following provides a modifier function to the verb
 - made sure the locative NP had non-empty SUBJ value with an NP [CASE loc] on it
 with a coindexed xarg and INDEX

locative-pp-phrase := unary-phrase &
[ SYNSEM [ NON-LOCAL #nl,
           LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD adp & [ MOD < [ LOCAL intersective-mod &
                                                    [ CAT.HEAD verb,
                                                      CONT.HOOK.INDEX #xarg ] ] > ],
		          VAL [ COMPS < >,
			        SUBJ < >,
			        SPR < > ]]],
    C-CONT [ HOOK [ LTOP #ltop,
		    INDEX #index,
		    XARG #xarg ],
	  RELS.LIST < arg12-ev-relation &
		   [ PRED "_loc_p_rel",
		     LBL #ltop,
		     ARG0 #index,
		     ARG1 #xarg,
		     ARG2 #dtr ] >,
	     HCONS.LIST < >  ],
	  ARGS < [ SYNSEM [ NON-LOCAL #nl,
		            LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD noun & [CASE loc],
		                          VAL.SPR < > ]],
			            CONT.HOOK [ INDEX #dtr ]]] > ].



Translation
- According to Bowern words such as ‘hungry’ and ‘thirsty’ are primarily nouns in Bardi, not
adjectives. The noun in the ergative and the experiencer as the subject is used
to construct a causal relation to express that one is hungry or thirsty,. (pp. 268)

- The other major use of the ergative is to mark low-animacy causers. In this
case the subject is the high-animacy patient and it takes the subject agreement
marker on the verb. (pp. 198)

- There is very littel evidence in the descriptive text to help with the translation of
the three sentences for this lab. We have used the different ways of constructing
non-verbals to translate them. Hence, multiple translations below. The page numbers are to
show evidenced examples pages off of which we have translated the sentences.

#15 preverb do.say
manyjal-nim alig iila i-rr-oo-j-ij
hunger-ERG feel.bad dog 3-AUG-TR-do.say-PFV
The dogs are hungry.
(p.268)

#15 verb -ni- 'sit' (hungry = sharp)
garrja i-ni-n ginyinggi jamooyoon.
sharp 3-sit-CONT 3MIN knife
`The knife is sharp'
(p.508)

#16 noun locative and -ni- 'sit.be' (park = cave)
iila-nim gardin-on i-rr-ni
dog-ERG park-LOC 3-AUG-be
The dogs are in the park.

OR

#16 noun locative (park = cave)
iila-nim gardin-on
dog-ERG park-LOC
The dogs are in the park.

OR

#16 null locative(park = beach)
iila-nim jaala i-rr-ni
dog-ERG park 3-AUG-be
The dogs are in the park.


no evidence of such a construction but maybe:

#17 for ergative involving -ni- 'sit.be'
iila-nim i-rr-ni-irr aarli
dog-ERG 3-AUG-be-3AUG cat
The dogs are the cats.

 OR

 #17 for null copula
 Ginyinggi iila aarli
 This dog cat
 `These dogs are cats.’

 OR

 #17 for null copula
 Ginyinggion iila aarli
 Ginyinggi-on iila aarli dog cat
 This-LOC
 `These dogs are cats.’’
