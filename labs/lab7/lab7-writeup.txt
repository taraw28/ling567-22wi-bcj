Phenomenon
 Non-Verbal Predicates
    
Bardi has nominal and adjectival predicates, and the copula is normally null (pp.601-610). 


Null Predicates:
 The presence of copula is independent of tense and can remain null for all tenses  
 Order of subject and predicate is flexible 
 Oblique pronouns (in the predicate) used along with a location case-marked noun in the subject can make copula predicates too.

  Example [doesn’t parse] (p.601):
   Ginyinggi aamba galgarr.
   This man widower
   `This man is a widower.’


Clauses with -ni- ‘sit’
 Combining the verb -ni- ‘sit’ in dfferent ways with predicative adjectives can be used as copula. 

Examples [don't parse]

garrja -ni- ‘be sharp’:

garrja i-ni-n ginyinggi jamooyoon.
sharp 3-sit-CONT 3MIN knife
`The knife is sharp'

  Location
   providing “spatial” information
   translated to ‘there was + noun + location/place (over there, in his camp)’

	 Assertion of existence
		 informing of the presence/existence (as opposed to absence) of the subject 
		 translated to ‘there is’ or ‘here is + noun’

	 Pointing out
		 both locational and existential; uses deictic marker jiiba ‘this’ 
   before the place to emphasize the location of something
		 translated to ‘this is it’ or ‘here it is’ 

	 Aspectual modification of adjectives
		 -ni- as a light verb used with an adjective creating syntactic minimal pairs 
   between sentences w/ complex predicate and those w/ null copula
		 translated to copula as in ‘be + adjective’
   
Elided verbs
 Verbs can only be seen elided in answers to questions having 
 a single noun phrase standing alone as the answer.
  Example [doesn’t parse] (p.609):
    Angginim goorr?
    Anggi-nim goorr
    what-ERG 2AUG
    ‘What’s wrong with you? What happened to you?’


 Wh-Questions and Copula 
  To make constituent (wh-) questions, Bardi uses a number of interrogative pronouns that usually
  appear clause initially. This analysis should work together with 
  The null-copula analysis of nominal non-verbal predicates. 
  
  Below is an example, which doesn't parse:

        Anggaba nyinga joo?
        Anggaba nyi-nga joo
        who 2MIN-name 2MIN
        `What’s your name?'
  
  
Translation
 According to Bowern words such as ‘hungry’ and ‘thirsty’ are primarily nouns in Bardi, not
 adjectives. The noun in the ergative and the experiencer as the subject is used 
 to construct a causal relation to express that one is hungry or thirsty,. (pp. 268)
 
 The other major use of the ergative is to mark low-animacy causers. In this 
 case the subject is the high-animacy patient and it takes the subject agreement 
 marker on the verb. (pp. 198)
 
 Here are the potential translations based on the analysis above and similar evidence in Bowern's descriptive text:

#15 involves preverb do.say
manyjal-nim alig iila i-rr-oo-j-ij
hunger-ERG feel.bad dog 3-AUG-TR-do.say-PFV
The dogs are hungry.


#15 involves verb -ni- 'sit' (hungry = sharp)
garrja i-ni-n ginyinggi jamooyoon.
sharp 3-sit-CONT 3MIN knife
`The knife is sharp'
(p.508)

#16 (park = cave)
iila-nim gardin-on i-rr-ni
dog-ERG park-LOC 3-AUG-be
The dogs are in the park.

(park = beach) (null locative)
iila-nim jaala i-rr-ni
dog-ERG park 3-AUG-be
The dogs are in the park.

no evidence of such a construction but maybe:

#17 for ergative 
iila-nim i-rr-ni-irr aarli
dog-ERG 3-AUG-be-3AUG cat
The dogs are the cats.
 
 OR
 #17 for null copula
 Ginyinggi iila aarli
 This dog cat
   `This man is a widower.’

        this is explained more as a new ambiguity source below)

      #5: 24 results (first test after adding negation)
      #18: 0 results (it parses in lkb but won't generate most likely because
        Bardi doesn't have determiners for nouns like "the" or "a"; it goes from
        "the dog" in English to "dog" in Bardi)
