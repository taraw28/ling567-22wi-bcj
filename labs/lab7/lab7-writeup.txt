Phenomenon
 Non-Verbal Predicates
    
Summary:

- Bardi has nominal and adjectival predicates, and the copula is normally null (pp.601-610). 
- Adjectives do not really exist independent of stative verbs. 
- There is no PP either, and NPs are used with a locative verb.
- Locative case is frequently used to indicate 'static location.'
- To give a stative reading to the predicate, the light verb -ni- ‘sit’ is used to
indicate states; for instance: iilan -ni- ‘be sick’; miyala -ni- ‘be awake’ (p. 538)
- Adjectival preverbs which form stative predicates with -ni- ‘sit’ may also
combine with the light verb -joo- ‘do/say’ to form inchoatives.

Below are the detailed ways non-verbal predicates are constructed:

Null Predicates:
 The presence of copula is independent of tense and can remain null for all tenses  
 Order of subject and predicate is flexible 
 Oblique pronouns (in the predicate) used along with a location case-marked noun in the subject can make copula predicates too.

  Example [doesn’t parse] (p.601):
   Ginyinggi aamba galgarr.
   This man widower
   `This man is a widower.’
   
   'Ginyinggi' is ...

Clauses with -ni- ‘sit’
 Combining the verb -ni- ‘sit’ in dfferent ways with predicative adjectives can be used as copula. 

Examples [don't parse]

garrja -ni- ‘be sharp’:

garrja i-ni-n ginyinggi jamooyoon.
sharp 3-sit-CONT 3MIN knife
`The knife is sharp'

Location
 providing “spatial” information
   translated to ‘there was + noun + location/place (over there, in his camp)’

Assertion of existence
 informing of the presence/existence (as opposed to absence) of the subject 
   translated to ‘there is’ or ‘here is + noun’

Pointing out
 both locational and existential; uses deictic marker _jiiba_ ‘this’ 
 before the place to emphasize the location of something
   translated to ‘this is it’ or ‘here it is’ 

Aspectual modification of adjectives
 -ni- as a light verb used with an adjective creating syntactic minimal pairs 
 between sentences w/ complex predicate and those w/ null copula
   translated to copula as in ‘be + adjective’
   
Elided verbs
 Verbs can only be seen elided in answers to questions having 
 a single noun phrase standing alone as the answer.
  
  Example [doesn’t parse] (p.609):
    Angginim goorr?
    Anggi-nim goorr
    what-ERG 2AUG
    ‘What’s wrong with you? What happened to you?’


 Wh-Questions and Copula 
  - To make constituent (wh-) questions, Bardi uses a number of interrogative pronouns that usually
  appear clause initially. This analysis should work together with 
  the null-copula analysis of nominal non-verbal predicates. 
  - I beleive this would could also be an "elided" verb way of constructing 
  non-verbal predicates explained above. 
  
  Below is an example, which doesn't parse:

        Anggaba nyinga joo?
        Anggaba nyi-nga joo
        who 2MIN-name 2MIN
        `What’s your name?'
  
  
Translation
 According to Bowern words such as ‘hungry’ and ‘thirsty’ are primarily nouns in Bardi, not
 adjectives. The noun in the ergative and the experiencer as the subject is used 
 to construct a causal relation to express that one is hungry or thirsty,. (pp. 268)
 
 The other major use of the ergative is to mark low-animacy causers. In this 
 case the subject is the high-animacy patient and it takes the subject agreement 
 marker on the verb. (pp. 198)
 
 There is very littel evidence in the descriptive text to help with the translation of 
 the three sentences for this lab. We have used the different ways of constructing 
 non-verbals to translate them. Hence, multiple translations below. The page numbers are to 
 show evidenced examples pages off of which we have translated the sentences. 

#15 preverb do.say
manyjal-nim alig iila i-rr-oo-j-ij
hunger-ERG feel.bad dog 3-AUG-TR-do.say-PFV
The dogs are hungry.
(p.268)

#15 verb -ni- 'sit' (hungry = sharp)
garrja i-ni-n ginyinggi jamooyoon.
sharp 3-sit-CONT 3MIN knife
`The knife is sharp'
(p.508)

#16 noun locative and -ni- 'sit.be' (park = cave)
iila-nim gardin-on i-rr-ni
dog-ERG park-LOC 3-AUG-be
The dogs are in the park.

OR 

#16 noun locative (park = cave)
iila-nim gardin-on 
dog-ERG park-LOC 
The dogs are in the park.

OR 

#16 null locative(park = beach) 
iila-nim jaala i-rr-ni
dog-ERG park 3-AUG-be
The dogs are in the park.


no evidence of such a construction but maybe:

#17 for ergative involving -ni- 'sit.be'
iila-nim i-rr-ni-irr aarli
dog-ERG 3-AUG-be-3AUG cat
The dogs are the cats.
 
 OR

 #17 for null copula 
 Ginyinggi iila aarli
 This dog cat
 `These dogs are cats.’
 
 OR 

 #17 for null copula 
 Ginyinggion iila aarli
 Ginyinggi-on iila aarli dog cat
 This-LOC 
 `These dogs are cats.’’
