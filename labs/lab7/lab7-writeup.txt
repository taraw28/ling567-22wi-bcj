 More Translation
    After further implementing some of the phenomena above, we went through and
    translated any sentences that we could. Below is a summary:
      #1: 2 results
      #2: 12 results (possibly the result of implementation of object dropping
        this is explained more as a new ambiguity source below)
      #3: 0 results (expected at this point)
      #4: 2 results
      #5: 24 results (first test after adding negation)
      #18: 0 results (it parses in lkb but won't generate most likely because
        Bardi doesn't have determiners for nouns like "the" or "a"; it goes from
        "the dog" in English to "dog" in Bardi)
      #19: 2 results

TSDB
  Initial Run
    corpus (tsdb/home/bardi/lab6/lab5grammar/corpus)
      1. 0 items parsed
      2. We averaged 0 parses per parsed item.
      3. Our most ambiguous item got 0 readings.

    testsuite (tsdb/home/bardi/lab6/lab5grammar/lab6)
      1. 13 items parsed
      2. We averaged ~2 parses per parsed item.
      3. Our most ambiguous item got 6 parses.
      4. Our most ambiguous item has 6 parses due to different combinations of
        the EX-ADJ and EX-SUBJ rules applying to the VP formed by the COMP-HEAD
        rule in this sentence:
          Ngamarlang nganangajimgal.
          nga-marla-ng nga-na-ngajim-gal
          1MIN.POSS-hand-INS 1-TR.PST-hit-REC.PST
          `I hit him with my hand.'
        This is an example of the possessive marker on an inalienable noun. We
        are not entirely sure why this is happening or really what those 2 rules
        are doing.

  Final Run
    corpus (tsdb/home/bardi/lab6/lab6grammar/corpus)
      1. 0 items parsed
      2. We averaged 0 parses per parsed item.
      3. Our most ambiguous item got 0 readings.

    testsuite (tsdb/home/bardi/lab6/lab6grammar/lab6)
      1. 12 items parsed
      2. We averaged ~2 parses per parsed item.
      3. Our most ambiguous item(s) got 4 parses.
      4. A new source of ambiguity is with the new direct object lexical rules.
        Since the 3min direct object marker is null, it is getting applied to
        a lot of sentences that shouldn't have it. In many cases, when there is
        an overt direct object, no marker is needed. However, there are also
        cases where a marker is allowed. I'm not entirely sure how to fix this.
