Lab 6 - Bardi - Tara and Hanieh

Translation
  We started with our original test case of sentence #2 "Dogs chase cars" that
  produced 19419 results. We updated semi.vpm for tense (all we had to do was
  remove the E from the feature path since Bardi only has past, present, and
  future tenses):
    E.TENSE : TENSE
      pst <> past
      prs <> present
      fut <> future
      * <> *
  This yielded 3072 results. We then updated semi.vpm for aspect. In addition
  to removing the E from the feature path, we also added a no-aspect aspect to
  the grammar. We did this because aspect is marked for some sentences but can
  be left undrespecified. We also included the appropriate lines semi.vpm (as
  described in the lab 6 instructions):
    E.ASPECT : ASPECT
      cont <> cont
      rem <> rem
      rec <> rec
      pfv <> pfv
      sim <> sim
      * >> no-aspect
      no-aspect << [e]
  This yielded 768 results. Next, we updated semi.vpm for pernum, making sure
  to have the appropriate values on each side (this took some trial and error
  until we got the syntax right):
    PNG.PERNUM : PER NUM
      3aug <> third pl
      2aug <> second pl
      1aug <> first pl
      3min <> third sg
      2min <> second sg
      1min_excl <> first sg
      1min_incl <> first pl
      1min <> first *
      3rd <> third *
      2nd <> second *
      1st <> first *
      aug <> pl *
      min <> sg *
  This yielded 192 results. From here we moved on to editing the lexicon and
  tdl files to reduce over-generation. As suggested, we removed iil (dog_n_rel)
  and just used iila for dog_n_rel. This yielded 96 results. It was also
  suggested that we combine the different prefixes for single inflectional
  rules. For example, we combined
    aug-prefix1 :=
    %prefix (* arr-)
    aug-lex-rule.

    aug-prefix2 :=
    %prefix (* rr-)
    aug-lex-rule.
  into one rule:
    aug-prefix1 :=
    %prefix (* arr-) (* rr-)
    aug-lex-rule.
  We did this with all of the inflectional rules and produced 12 results. At
  this point we tested sentence #4 (Dogs eat) which resulted in 52 results. We
  removed all variations of irli (eat_v_rel) from the lexicon and yielded 10
  results. Now, the only factors producing this number of results was the fact
  that Bardi has free word-order (6 different possibilities) and that the
  transitive marker was optional (2 possibilities). Based off of what was shown
  during demo day and the files sent as a result (thank you!), we were able to
  constrain the transitivity marker using the customization system. We did this
  using require and forbid constraints. Transitive verbs required the tr-min or
  tr-aug position classes and intransitive verbs forbade them. For example,
    verb1_name=it-abs
      verb1_feat1_name=case
      verb1_feat1_value=abs
      verb1_feat1_head=subj
    verb1_valence=intrans

  This brought us down to 6 results for sentence #2 and #4! We also tested
  sentence #19 (My dogs sleep) and got 4 results.
