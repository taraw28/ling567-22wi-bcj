Your write up should be a plain text file (not .doc, .rtf or .pdf) which includes the following:
1.A description of the phenomena you improved in the choices file, including:

Prose description of the phenomenon
Prose description of your analysis

The specific changes you made to choices (paste in the actual choices)

	include copy paste of the specific choices values you changed as well as relevant IGT that I can use to test the effects.

Specific IGT I can use to test the analysis / investigate if something isn't working and you need help.

2.A description of your process for translating the MMT sentences and your documentation about which sentences may be impossible.

3.A description what happened when you tried the MT set up. What difficulties did you encounter and how did you resolve them? What output did you get?
