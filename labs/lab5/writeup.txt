3. Wh-Questions

- Description of the Phenomenon 
	
To make constituent (wh-) questions, Bardi uses a number of interrogative pronouns that usually appear clause initially. Below are some examples to show how they are used:

 	Anggaba nyinga joo?
        Anggaba nyi-nga joo
        who 2MIN-name 2MIN
        `Whatâ€™s your name?'	 

	Angan minyjarralagal joornk?
        Angan mi-ny-jarrala-gal joornk
        why 2-PST-run-REC.PST fast
        `Why did you run so fast?'

- Analysis

To fix the grammar for wh-questions to parse, we changed the predicates to meanings of the wh-word (who -> person, what -> thing, etc.).  

Below are the updated choice values:


noun2_name=question-pronoun
  noun2_inter=on
  noun2_det=imp
    noun2_stem1_orth=anggaba
    noun2_stem1_pred=_person_n_rel
    noun2_stem2_orth=janambooroo
    noun2_stem2_pred=_place_n_rel
    noun2_stem3_orth=angan
    noun2_stem3_pred=_reason_n_rel
    noun2_stem4_orth=goonban
    noun2_stem4_pred=_reason.on.earth_n_rel
    noun2_stem5_orth=anggi
    noun2_stem5_pred=_thing_n_rel
    noun2_stem6_orth=baanigarr
    noun2_stem6_pred=_time_n_rel
    noun2_stem7_orth=nyanyjirrgoordoo
    noun2_stem7_pred=_number_n_rel


This led to successful parsing of the follwoing sentences including 'what' and 'who'which are now predicated as _thing_n_rel and _person_n_rel, respectively. 
Changes were made to all the predicates, and the two below were tested for parsing. 


IGTs for the parsed wh-questions:

source: author
vetted: f
judgment: g
Anggaba I-ny-jarrmi-n
who-ERG 3-PST-get.up-REM.PST
`Who got up?'

source: author  
vetted: f
judgment: g
Anggi Inyjarrmin
Anggi I-ny-jarrmi-n
what 3-PST-get.up-REM.PST
`What got up?'


* Translation Process


- A description of your process for translating the MMT sentences and your documentation about which sentences may be impossible.

We added some lexicon (for example "dog" and "chase") to be able to have more to translate; however, we will need to replace the word "sleep" with a different verb as "sleep" in Bardi is a light verb leading to complex verb combinations, and needs to be differently.

I chase you.
Dogs in the park eat.
What do the dogs chase?



Dogs sleep -> "Sleep" is a light verb in Bardi and changes meaning. We don't know what the actual Bardi equivalent of "sleep" is.
Dogs chase cars -> We don't know the word for "cars" in Bardi
The dogs dont chase cars -> involves Negation that we haven't worked on yet.
I think that you know that dogs chase cars -> haven't worked on complex sentences
I ask whether you know that dogs chase cars -> haven't worked on complex sentences
Cats and dogs chase cars -> We don't know the word for "cats" in Bardi.
Dogs chase cars and cats chase dogs -> We don't know the word for "cats" in Bardi.
Cats chase dogs and sleep -> ditto on "cats" and "sleep" is a complex verb/
Do cats chase dogs -> ditto on "cats"
Hungry dogs eat -> We haven't worked on "adjectives" but it should be easy to add (hungry in Bardi is manyjal) 
Dogs in the park eat -> We don't know the word for "park" in Bardi. 
Dogs eat in the park -> ditto on park
The dogs are hungry -> We haven't worked on auxiliary verbs and adjectives.
The dogs are in the park -> ditto on auxiliary verbs
The dogs are the cats -> ditto on auxiliary
The dog s car sleeps -> ditto on "sleep" 
My dogs sleep -> ditto on "sleep"
Who sleeps -> ditto on "sleep" 
What do you think the dogs chase -> we haven't worked on complex sentences
Who asked what the dogs chase -> we haven't worked with complex sentences; we might be able to translate this one using wh-words
I asked what the dogs chased -> ditto 
The dog sleeps because the cat sleeps -> ditto on sleep; we haven't done adverbial clauses (our reason class)
The dog sleeps after the cat sleeps -> ditto on sleep;the word ajimorrony does exists, but we haven't found anything to see how "after" is used in Bardi.  
	

After adding the word "dog" and replacing the Bardi "fish" with "car," in our lexicon for this lab, we could translate the following:

"Dogs chase cars."
"Dogs eat."




#1
Iil daag irri.
iil daag i-rr-i
dog sleep 3-AUG-do/say
`Dogs sleep.'

#2
Iilanim irroongoorribi aarli.
iila-nim i-rr-oo-ngoorribi aarli
dog-ERG 3-AUG-TR-chase fish
`Dogs chase fish.'

#3
Nganangoorribirri.
nga-na-ngoorribi=rri
1-TR-chase=2MIN.DO
`I chase you.'

#4
Iil irrarli.
iil i-rr-arli.
dog 3-AUG-eat
`Dogs eat.'

#5
Arra iila-nim i-rr-oo-ngoorribi yandilybar.
arra iila-nim i-rr-oo-ngoorribi yandilybar
NEG dog-ERG 3-AUG-TR-chase boat
`The dogs don't chase boats.'


Lexicon wise, after we replace the verb "sleep" with an existing intrastive one, and "cat" with a different noun since we don't know it in Bardi, whe should be able to translate all the following:

Dogs sleep. 
I chase you.
Dogs in the park eat.
What do the dogs chase?
Cats chase dogs and sleep
The dog s car sleeps
My dogs sleep
Who sleeps





When translating from eng to sje, the first sentence parsed with 1 reading; it generated 1 sentence and the transfer did 4 successful unifies and 2 failed ones. 
We also had to remove ex-det := extracted-det-phrase. line from rules.tdl to get it to compile which led to a successful compilation.

eng to bardi:

The first attempt to translate "Dogs chase cars" was unsucessful because our lexicon didn't have "cars" which we manually fixed by changing "fish" in Bardi to _car_n_rel in our lexicon.tdl.



- A description what happened when you tried the MT set up. What difficulties did you encounter and how did you resolve them? What output did you get?

The MT set up was pretty straight forward except the following few issues that we ran into:

	- had to remove ex-det := extracted-det-phrase. line from rules.tdl to get it to compile.
	-  We didn't quite understand what .sh manipulation did except  
	- Running into "does not appear to be a grammar image." error. which Tara posted to Canvas, but since Hanieh didn't run into it, Tara deleted everything, and redid the whole process, and it got fixed. 
	- Ran into RAM issue (Hanieh) which killed translations of both second and forth sentences to at the almost the 1600 translations, but increase of VM RAM allowed more than 16000 and 18000, respectively.
