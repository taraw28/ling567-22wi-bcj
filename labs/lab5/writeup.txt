Subject Agreement Morphology

Prefixes mostly display agreement for the subject of the clause 

- Inflecting verbs agree for the subject of the verb, whether intransitive or transitive.
- Subject agreement is prefixal and is bound with tense marking,    
- while oblique, possessive, and direct object agreement is cliticized to the end of the verb stem.
- subject agreements of predicate (non-constituent according to Bowern) can be hosted on verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs
   
  # examples of agreement with verb as host

Wh-Questions

Description of the Phonomena: 
	
Bardi uses a number of interrogative pronouns that usually appear clause initially, however,it can appear non-initially as well. The pronoun "angabba" is used for "who", "janambooroo for
      "where", and "angan" for "why". For example,	 

Analysis

- The predicates where replaced with thing,place,person, etc., and this led to successful parsing of the follwoing sentences including 'what' and 'who'which are now predicated as _thing_n_rel and _person_n_rel, respectively. Changes were made to all the predicates, but only the two were tested for parsing. 

Below are the updated choice values:


noun2_name=question-pronoun
  noun2_inter=on
  noun2_det=imp
    noun2_stem1_orth=anggaba
    noun2_stem1_pred=_person_n_rel
    noun2_stem2_orth=janambooroo
    noun2_stem2_pred=_place_n_rel
    noun2_stem3_orth=angan
    noun2_stem3_pred=_reason_n_rel
    noun2_stem4_orth=goonban
    noun2_stem4_pred=_reason.on.earth_n_rel
    noun2_stem5_orth=anggi
    noun2_stem5_pred=_thing_n_rel
    noun2_stem6_orth=baanigarr
    noun2_stem6_pred=_time_n_rel

Translation Process


- A description of your process for translating the MMT sentences and your documentation about which sentences may be impossible.

We added some lexicon (for example "dog" and "chase") to be able to have more to translate; however, we will need to replace the word "sleep" with a different verb as "sleep" in Bardi is a light verb leading to complex verb combinations, and needs to be differently.

I chase you.
Dogs in the park eat.




- Any sentence including the word "dog" is impossible to translate because The following sentences are impossible to translte:

Dogs sleep -> "Sleep" is a light verb in Bardi and changes meaning. We don't know what the actual Bardi equivalent of "sleep" is.
Dogs chase cars -> We don't know the word for "cars" in Bardi
The dogs dont chase cars -> involves Negation that we haven't worked on yet.
I think that you know that dogs chase cars
I ask whether you know that dogs chase cars
Cats and dogs chase cars -> We don't know the word for "cats" in Bardi.
Dogs chase cars and cats chase dogs -> We don't know the word for "cats" in Bardi.
Cats chase dogs and sleep -> ditto on "cats" and "sleep" is a complex verb/
Do cats chase dogs -> ditto on "cats"
Hungry dogs eat -> We haven't worked on "adjectives" but it should be easy to add (hungry in Bardi is manyjal) 
Dogs in the park eat -> We don't know the word for "park" in Bardi. 
Dogs eat in the park -> ditto on park
The dogs are hungry
The dogs are in the park
The dogs are the cats
The dog s car sleeps
My dogs sleep
Who sleeps
What do the dogs chase
What do you think the dogs chase
Who asked what the dogs chase
I asked what the dogs chased
The dog sleeps because the cat sleeps
The dog sleeps after the cat sleeps
	- .... because it involves ... phonomenon that we haven't gotten to yet.
