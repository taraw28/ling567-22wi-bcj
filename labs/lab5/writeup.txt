Subject Agreement Morphology

Prefixes mostly display agreement for the subject of the clause 

- Inflecting verbs agree for the subject of the verb, whether intransitive or transitive.
- Subject agreement is prefixal and is bound with tense marking,    
- while oblique, possessive, and direct object agreement is cliticized to the end of the verb stem.
- subject agreements of predicate (non-constituent according to Bowern) can be hosted on verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs

    Polar Interrogatives
    
    In her book, Bowern points out two main ways of creating yes/no questions in Bardi:
    
- with a separate interrogative particle "nganyji" that usually appears first in the clause. 
    - questions the proposition in the clause as a whole. For example,
-  with an affix "(g)arda" and "bard(a)" attached to the relevant word (Bowern refers to these as clitics).
    - interract with focus and is used to question particular constituents in a sentence. 
    - The clitic attaches to the element under interrogation (i.e. the part of the sentence the focus is on). For example,

	- The following sentences are impossible to translte:
		- .... because it involves ... phonomenon that we haven't gotten to yet.
