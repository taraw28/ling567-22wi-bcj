Lab 4 - Bardi - Tara and Hanieh

Note, I renamed the TSDB profiles to hopefully make them easier to find. I included the paths
with each run.

TSDB
  Initial Run
    corpus (tsdb/home/bardi/lab4/lab3grammar/corpus)
      1. 2 items parsed
      2. We averaged 44 parses per parsed item. (62 for one sentence, 26 for the other sentence)
      3. Our most ambiguous item got 62 readings.
      4. A lot of the ambiguity comes from the noun and verb top and bottom coordination rules.
        One of our noun position classes is optional but should be required so it tried to apply the
        position class to sentences, resulting in ambiguity. There is also ambiguity from how the
        sentences are formed however, I think this is something that will require editing tdl files
        to fix.

    testsuite (tsdb/home/bardi/lab4/lab3grammar/lab4)
    1. 4 items parsed
    2. We averaged 5 parses per parsed item. (12 for one sentence, 6 for 2 sentences, and 1 for 1
      sentence)
    3. Our most ambiguous item got 12 readings.
    4. Most of the ambiguity is from the optional noun position classes mentioned above. The other
      source is with the way that sentences are formed, same as with the corpus.

  Final Run
    corpus (tsdb/home/bardi/lab4/lab4grammar/corpus)
      1. 2 items parsed
      2. 9 parses per item (14 parses for one sentence, 4 for the other)
      3. Our most ambiguous item got 14 readings.
      4. Having eliminated the optional noun position class ambiguity, most of the ambiguity is
        coming from the top and bottom coordination rules. For the second sentence, it looks
        like one of our nouns is duplicated in the lexicon so the only other source is using the
        basic-head-opt-comp rule versus the subj-head rule to form the sentence.

    testsuite (tsdb/home/bardi/lab4/lab4grammar/lab4)
      1. 2 items parsed
      2. We average 4 parses per parsed item. (4 for each sentence)
      3. Our most ambiguous item(s) got 4 readings.
      4. One source of ambiguity was again the use of the basic-head-opt-comp rule versus the
        subj-head rule to form the sentence. The other was, once again, duplicate entries in
        the lexicon. However, this one relates to the ill-formed position classes as it has an
        affix as the root instead of the word with semantic meaning. Some affixes have the same
        spelling but have slightly different purposes.

  Coverage
    - Initial Run
      - corpus: 1.1% coverage
      - testsuite: 4.9% coverage
    - Final Run
      - corpus: 1.1% coverage
      - testsuite: 0% coverage
    - Comparison
      - corpus: stayed the same
      - testsuite: decreased :(
      - Even though coverage did not improve, we did decrease a lot of ambiguity (which, in
        combination with additional test items, is most likely the reason for the coverage
        decreasing)

Phenomena/Choices
  Questions
    Polar Interrogatives
      There are two main ways of creating yes/no questions in Bardi. The first is with a separate
      interrogative particle that usually appears first in the clause. The particle is "nganyji"
      and it questions the proposition in the clause as a whole. For example,

        #1
        Nganyji minjalagal jiyirr ooldoobal.
        Nganyji mi-n-jala-gal jiy-irr ooldoobal
        INTERROG 2-TR-see-REC.PST 2M.POSS-3A things
        `Did you see your things?'

        #2
        Nganyji ngay ngankiida Broomengan?
        Nganyji ngay nga-n-k-iid-a Broome-ngan
        INTERROG 1MIN 1-TR-FUT-go-FUT Broome-ALL
        `Will I go to Broome?'

        #3
        Nganyji lol inyjiidigal jan mayar?
        Nganyji lol i-ny-jiidi-gal jan mayar
        INTERROG burn 3-PST-go-REC.PST 1MIN.POSS house
        `Did my house burn?'

      We added this to the grammer with the following:

        section=matrix-yes-no
        q-part=on
        q-part-order=before
          q-particle1_orth=nganyji
          q-particle1_wh=oblig

      However, we were unable to get any of these sentences to parse as our lexicon is still
      lacking some words. We plan to work this weekend on updating our lexicon to include all or
      almost all of the words we used in our testsuite.

      The second is with an affix attached to the relevant word (Bowern refers to these as clitics).
      These clitics - "(g)arda" and "bard(a)" - interract with focus and is used to question
      particular constituents in a sentence. The clitic attaches to the element under interrogation
      (i.e. the part of the sentence the focus is on). For example,

        #4
        Gooyarrarda aarli minnyagal?
        Gooyarr-arda aarli mi-n-nya-gal
        two-INTERROG fish 2-TR.PST-catch-REC.PST
        `Was it TWO fish you caught?

        #5
        Ngayarda ngankiida Broomengan, gardi joowarda?
        Ngay-arda nga-n-k-iid-a Broome-ngan, gardi joo-warda
        1MIN-INTERROG 1-TR-FUT-go-FUT Broome-ALL or 2MIN-INTERROG
        `Will *I* go to Broome today or will it be YOU?'

        #6
        Ginyinggi ball garndi inin bardagonbard?
        Ginyinggi ball garndi i-ni-n bardagon-bard
        3MIN ball on.top 3-sit-CONT tree-LOC-INTERROG
        `Is the ball at the top of the TREE?'

        #7
        Ginyinggarda jina jiiwa minjoogoolij?
        Ginyingg=arda jina jiiwa mi-n-joogool-ij
        3min=INTERROG 3M.POSS boomerang 2-TR-break-PFV
        `Was it HIS boomerang you broke?'

        #8
        Nyimoonggoon ginyingginim aamba joowarda jiy iila inangajim?
        Nyi-moonggoon ginyinggi-nim aamba joo=warda jiy iila i-na-ngajim
        2-know 3MIN-ERG man 2MIN=INTERROG 2M.POSS dog 3-TR-hit
        `Do you know if it was the man who hit YOUR dog?'

      We were unable to add this to our grammar as it takes the second position on a word which is
      in direct conflict with "nganyji", which takes the first position in the sentence. We tried
      to add it with the following:

          section=wh-q
          focus-marking=on

          section=info-str
            c-focus-marker1_type=affix

          noun-pc34_name=question-affix
          noun-pc34_obligatory=on
          noun-pc34_order=suffix
          noun-pc34_inputs=noun
              noun-pc34_lrt1_feat1_name=information-structure meaning
              noun-pc34_lrt1_feat1_value=contrast-focus
              noun-pc34_lrt1_feat1_head=itself
              noun-pc34_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
              noun-pc34_lrt1_lri1_orth=arda
              noun-pc34_lrt1_lri2_inflecting=yes
              noun-pc34_lrt1_lri2_orth=garda
              noun-pc34_lrt1_lri3_inflecting=yes
              noun-pc34_lrt1_lri3_orth=bard
              noun-pc34_lrt1_lri4_inflecting=yes
              noun-pc34_lrt1_lri4_orth=barda

      However, this prevented any sentence from parsing. We might have to do this in the future by
      modifying tdl files. Any other input you have on why this might not work would be very helpful.

    Wh- Questions
      Bardi uses a number of interrogative pronouns that usually appear first in the clause, however
      it can appear non-initially as well. The pronoun "angabba" is used for "who", "janambooroo for
      "where", and "angan" for "why". For example,

        #9
        Anggaba nyinga joo?
        Anggaba nyi-nga joo
        who 2MIN-name 2MIN
        `What’s your name?'

        #10
        Janambooroongan arr mindin?
        Janambooroo-ngan arr mi-n-di-n
        where-ALL go 2-TR-do/say-CONT
        `Where are you going?'

        #11
        Angan minyjarralagal joornk?
        Angan mi-ny-jarrala-gal joornk
        why 2-PST-run-REC.PST fast
        `Why did you run so fast?'

        The pronoun "goonban(kij)" is used to indicate a speaker's disapproval of an action and is
        usually translated as "why on earth." For example,

        #12
        Goonban barda minagal jan aarli?
        Goonban barda mi-n-a-gal jan aarli
        why.on.earth away 2-TR-give-REC.PST 1M.POSS fish
        `Why on earth did you give my fish away?'

        #13
        Goonbankij minjoolnggaljin?
        Goonban=kij mi-n-joolng-gal=jin
        why.on.earth=VERY 2-TR-tell-REC.PST=3M.IO
        `Why on earth did you tell him?’

      We added a noun class to contain these pronouns:

        noun27_name=question-pronoun
        noun27_inter=on
        noun27_det=opt
          noun27_stem1_orth=anggaba
          noun27_stem1_pred=_who_n_rel
          noun27_stem2_orth=janambooroo
          noun27_stem2_pred=_where_n_rel
          noun27_stem3_orth=angan
          noun27_stem3_pred=_why_n_rel
          noun27_stem4_orth=goonban
          noun27_stem4_pred=_why.on.earth_n_rel
          noun27_stem5_orth=anggi
          noun27_stem5_pred=_what_n_rel
          noun27_stem6_orth=baanigarr
          noun27_stem6_pred=_when_n_rel

      We focused more on yes/no questions for our testsuite so we weren't able to properly test if
      these parse correctly (and they most likely wouldn't have due to missing words in the
      lexicon).

    Double Interrogatives
      More than one interrogative pronoun can appear in a clause. Multiple interrogatives are
      allowed and there are few restrictions on the order. The difference in meaning appears to
      depend on which interrogative has greater focus. For example,

        #14
        Anggabanim anggi inarligal?
        Anggaba-nim anggi i-na-rli-gal
        who-ERG what 3-TR-eat-REC.PST
        `Who ate what?'

      When it comes to multiple interrogatives with both arguments and adjuncts, however, the
      judgements are different. This is one of the few places in the grammar where there are
      differences between a free adjunct and an argument phrase. For example, multiple
      interrogatives involving "janaboor" (where) are fine when the adjunct is fronted before
      "anggaba" (who), but only if the verb is final. For example,

        #15
        Anggaba minjalagal janaboor?
        Anggaba mi-n-jala-gal janaboor
        who 2-TR-see-REC.PST where
        `Who did you see where?'

        #16
        Janaboor anggaba minjalagal?
        Janaboor anggaba mi-n-jala-gal
        where who 2-TR-see-REC.PST
        `Who did you see where?'

        #17 ungrammatical
        Janaboor minjalagal anggaba
        Janaboor mi-n-jala-gal anggaba
        where 2-TR-see-REC.PST who
        `Intended: Who did you see where?'

        #18
        Nyanyjirrgoordoo aarli minjooloonggalirr baanigarr?
        Nyanyjirrgoordoo aarli mi-n-jooloong-gal=irr baanigarr?
        how.many fish 2M-TR-collect-REC.PST=3A.DO when
        `How many fish did you collect when?/When did you collect how many fish?’

        #19 ungrammatical
        Angging nyanyjirrgoordoo aarli minjooloonggalirr?
        Anggi-ng nyanyjirrgoordoo aarli mi-n-jooloong-gal-irr
        what-INS how.many fish 2M-TR-collect-REC.PST-3A.DO
        `Intended: With what did you collect how many fish?'

      Since we didn't quite get to finishing wh-questions, we did not get a chance to implement
      this. Do you have any pointers on how enforce these constraints via customization? Or is this
      something we will have to do with tdl files?

  Argument Optionality
    Bardi has free argument omission (pro-drop). It allows subjsects and objects to be dropped.
    Pronouns are not syntactically obligatory in the clause and are not used for reference tracking.

    Even in cases of potentially ambiguous argument tracking, free NPs or pronouns are seldom used.
    The ambiguity is tolerated, though there is some assumption of argument continuity (that is,
    that subjects continue subjects and objects continue objects); however, likelihood and real
    world knowledge are used to infer who is doing what.

    In the following example argument continuity is inferred by the absence of free NPs or pronouns
    and the subject marking on the verb provides information about which participants. Context
    identifies the referent of the verb agreement. The following example contains no argument NPs
    or pronouns at all; the only NPs are place names or locations.

      #20 Note, this example is just to show this feature, it was not included in our testsuite as
        it is far too complex.
      Roowil ingirrinyana Ngalngoorarra yoorr ingarraman Balalbalalngarr daab ingirrinyan goona
        goorriron.
      Roowil i-ng-irr-i-nya-na Ngalngoorarra yoorr i-ng-arr-a-ma-n Balalbalalngarr daab
        i-ng-irr-i-nya-n goona goorrir-on

        3-PST-AUG-TR-catch-REM.PST back fig.tree-LOC
      `They walked to Ngalngoorarra and came down at Balalbalalngarr, and climbed up at the big fig
        tree.'

      #21
      Roowil ingirrinyana Ngalngoorarra.
      Roowil i-ng-irr-i-nya-na Ngalngoorarra
      walk 3-PST-AUG-TR-catch-REM.PST Ngalngoorarra
      `They walked to Ngalngoorarra.'

    Heads of relative clauses, for example, can be omitted. Both speech act participants can be
    omitted. Subjects and objects of gerunds can be omitted, even though they are not cross-
    referenced on the verb. However, there are contexts under which free noun phrases appear not to
    be omissible. Pronouns cannot be omitted if the argument is in focus. But, if they are in
    special focus, they may also get reinforcement such as with the exclamative "arra". For example,

      #22
      Arra ngay bard arr ngandan.
      Arra ngay bard arr nga-n-da-n
      INTERJ 1MIN away come 1-TRdo/say-CONT
      `Hey look! It’s ME coming.'

      #23
      Ngayoonim ngananarri malarr.
      Ngayoo-nim nga-na-na-rri malarr
      1MIN-ERG 1-CONT-REM.PST-2M.DO wife
      `I gave you wives.'

    The following show that the ergative differentiates subject from oblique. It is not omissible
    even when the semantic roles are clear from context.

      #24
      Inyjargijin ngaarri.
      I-ny-jargi-jin ngaarri
      3-PST-fear-3MIN.IO devil.ABS
      `The devil was afraid of him.'

      #25
      Maanka injoogal gaara noorroonim.
      Maanka i-n-joo-gal gaara n˙oorroo-nim
      black 3-[PST]-TR-do/say-REC.PST sand fire-ERG
      `The ground got black from the fire.'

    In some cases, the presence or absence of overt nominal material appears to be grammatically
    constrained. In the following Bardi sentence, the noun "oorany" is not omissible:

      #26
      Jaarla nganjalagal *(oorany) wiliwilon inkalgal.
      Jaarla nga-n-jala-gal *(oorany) wiliwil-on i-n-kal-gal
      beach(ø-loc) 1M-TR-see- 	woman fishing 3M-TR-visit-REC.PST
      `I saw a woman on the beach, she was fishing. / I saw the woman fishing on the beach.'

    Pronouns (or free nouns) which are part of a coordinated phrase cannot be omitted:

      #27
      Monty, Lionel agal ngayoo angarrjarrarra barda Broomengan.
      Monty, Lionel agal ngayoo a-ng-arr-jarrarra barda Broome-ngan
      M. L. and 1MIN 1-PST-AUG-get.up. away B.-ALL
      `Monty, Lionel and I got up and went off to Broome.'

    We originally made the following changes to the choices file for argument optionality:

      section=arg-opt
      subj-drop=subj-drop-all
      subj-mark-drop=subj-mark-drop-req
      subj-mark-no-drop=subj-mark-no-drop-req
      subj-con=subj-con-some
      obj-drop=obj-drop-all
      obj-mark-drop=obj-mark-drop-req
      obj-mark-no-drop=obj-mark-no-drop-req

    However, it made it so our test cases didn't pass. We changed it back to what it was originally
    (and added that omission occurs in some casees) and our sentences parsed again.

      section=arg-opt
      subj-drop=subj-drop-all
      subj-mark-drop=subj-mark-drop-opt
      subj-mark-no-drop=subj-mark-no-drop-opt
      subj-con=subj-con-some
      obj-drop=obj-drop-all
      obj-mark-drop=obj-mark-drop-opt
      obj-mark-no-drop=obj-mark-no-drop-opt

  Possession
    There are five ways in which possession is marked for nouns in Bardi. We focused on three of
    them for this lab.

    Free Possessive Pronouns
      When free possessor pronouns are  used as possessives, they take the form of compound
      pronouns, which specify information for the person and number of both possessor and possessum.
      Possessive pronouns can lose the aug markin gif the possessum is non-individuated. Possessors
      and possessums can have different persons and numbers. For example,

        #28
        Ngajana bo inambijjan goorlil.
        Ngajana bo i-na-m-b-ij-jan goorlil.
        1M.POSS woman's.child 3-TR-PST-poke-PFV-1M.IO turtle
        `My son speared a turtle.'

        #29
        Ngajana gooloo bard roowil innyana.
        Ngajana gooloo bard roowil i-n-nya-na
        1M.POSS father off walk 3M-TR-catch-REM.PST
        `My father walked off.'

        #30
        Minjalagal jiyirr ooldoobal.
        mi-n-jala-gal jiy-irr ooldoobal
        2-TR-see-REC.PST 2M.POSS-3A things
        `You see your things.'

        #31
        Jina jiiwa minjoogoolij.
        jina jiiwa mi-n-joogool-ij
        3M.POSS boomerang 2-TR-break-PFV
        You broke his boomerang.

        #32
        Lol inyjiidigal jan mayar
        lol i-ny-jiidi-gal jan mayar
        burn 3-PST-go-REC.PST 1MIN.POSS house
        `My house burned.'

        #33
        Ginyingginim injooloonggal ajawirr irrol.
        ginyinggi-nim i-n-jooloong-gal ajaw-irr irrol
        3MIN-ERG 3-TR-PST-pick.up-REC.PST 1+2M.POSS-3AUG spear.ABS
        `He picked up our spears.'

      The possessive pronouns were added to the choices file as shown below:

        section=adnom-poss
          poss-pron1_type=non-affix
          poss-pron1_agr=non-agree
          poss-pron1_mod-spec=spec

            poss-pron1_instance7_name=joogarra
            poss-pron1_instance7_orth=joogarra
              poss-pron1_instance7_feat1_name=pernum
              poss-pron1_instance7_feat1_value=2aug
            poss-pron1_instance8_name=jirra
            poss-pron1_instance8_orth=jirra
              poss-pron1_instance8_feat1_name=pernum
              poss-pron1_instance8_feat1_value=3aug
          poss-pron1_possessum-mark=no

        Again, because of issues with the lexicon, we were unable to fully test if our
        implementation correctly parses any sentences.

    Inalienable Nouns
      Bardi has a set of inalienable possessed nouns which take prefixes for the person and number
      of the possessor. A select number of inalienable nouns take possessive prefixes. The others
      take regular possessive pronouns. Examples of ones with possessive prefixes are shown below:

        #34
        Ngamarlang nganangajimgal.
        nga-marla-ng nga-na-ngajim-gal
        1M.POSS-hand-INS 1-TR-PST-hit-REC.PST
        `I  hit him with my hand.'

        #35
        Aamba ninga Ngoolmoongoolmoo.
        aamba ni-nga Ngoolmoongoolmoo
        man 3.POSS-name Ngoolmoongoolmoo
        `The man's name was Ngoolmoongoolmoo.'

      For the possessive affixes, we added the following to the choices file:

        poss-pron1_possessum-mark=no
        poss-pron2_type=affix
        poss-pron2_agr=non-agree
        poss-pron2_mod-spec=spec

      We are not entirely sure this is even implemented as it does not show up in the matrix
      customization even though it exists in the choices file. Due to this, we did not add the
      prefixes to the morphology section.

    Possessive Pronouns with Verbs
      Unlike the other languages in Bardi's language family, sometimes posessive pronouns can
      migrate from the DP to the verb. The only difference between possessive marking on the verb
      and oblique pronouns is the position of the affix, since they can co-occur. The marking of
      possession on the verb is not obligatory and it can alternate with marking within the noun
      phrase. For example

        #36
        Ginyingginim injoogooloojan daanggoo
        Ginyinggi-nim i-n-joogooloo-jan daanggoo
        3MIN-ERG 3-TR-break-1M.POSS jaw
        `He broke my jaw.'

        #37
        Joonim jiyarr bo irrjarginjinan bo.
        Joo-nim jiya-rr bo i-rr-jargi-n-jin-an bo
        2MIN-ERG 2M.POSS-3A woman’s.child 3-AUG-fear-CONT-3M.IO=1M.POSS woman’s.child
        `Your children are frightened of my children.'

      The choices files issues for inalienable nouns also apply here.

Below is a list of other changes made to the choices file that did not fit in with any of the
phenomena described above:
  - made the case position class obligatory
  - removed the ins case (also removed it from the case position class (pc))
  - removed the loc-all pc (as advised in lab 3 comments)
  - added min and aug number
    - added inclusive/exclusive min and updated lexicon/morphology to match
    - 1min_excl in choices is equivalent to 1min in glosses
    - 1min_incl in choices is equivalent to 1+2min in glosses

We also attempted to remove a bunch of ill-formed verb and noun position classes. However, since
we didn't add any new position classes, we were no longer able to parse any sentences so we
reverted back to including them until we could work on better verb position classes.
