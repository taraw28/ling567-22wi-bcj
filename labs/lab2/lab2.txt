(Yes, you may share this and future write ups with students working on the AGGREGATION project.)

Using the grammar files from the provided resources for Bardi, downloaded the choice file, uploaded it into customization system in order to produce the grammar. During this step only two question marks popped up:
  General Information:
    changed it to
  Sentential Auxiliary Verb
    unchecked: Negative auxiliary verb: Checking this box creates a neg-aux type which contributes a neg_rel that outscopes it's complement's handle. This lexical type will show up on the lexicon page where you'll need to further specify its syntax.

Starting off by running the virtual box and lkb in Ubuntu through the terminal, we accessed emacs &, initialized Lui, ran tsdb:tsdb :podium to access the tsdb Podium where we needed to add the following to the .bashrc, or it would not allow creating testsuite:
  - added code to .bashrc as recommended by Tom
  - added .lkbrc file as instructed

As the running was taking a long time, we removed sentences 1470 and 1600 that got stuck in the running process which led to a faster browse of the results.

Results after creating and running an initial test suite instance
  1. How many items parsed?
    0 items parsed (attempted to parse 176 but none were able to be parsed)
  2. What is the average number of parses per parsed item?
    0
  3. How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive?
    0
  4. What sources of ambiguity can you identify?
    none, no sentences were able to parse (either due to missing lexical entries or missing lexical rules)
  5. For 10 items (if you have at least that many parsing), do any of the parses look reasonable in the semantics? (Emily will demo in class on Thursday.)
    again, no sentences were able to parse (see above)

Our grammar couldn’t parse any sentences, and we made the following improvements to the grammar customization focusing on the two phonomena of Case and Tense/Aspect:
  - added tenses/aspects
  - added case

Results after incorporating testsuite (same results in test corpus as initial run)
  1. How many items parsed?
    0 (attempted to parse 17 but none were able to be parsed)
  2. What is the average number of parses per parsed item?
    0
  3. How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive?
    0
  4. What sources of ambiguity can you identify?
    none, no sentences were able to parse (either due to missing lexical entries or missing lexical rules)
  5. For 10 items (if you have at least that many parsing), do any of the parses look reasonable in the semantics? (Emily will demo in class on Thursday.)
    again, no sentences were able to parse (see above)

Tense/Aspect
  In Bardi, certain tense prefixes and tense/aspect suffixes have co-occurrence restrictions. The future suffix -a may only occur with the future, imperative, or irrealis prefixes.
    -n continuative CONT
    -na remote past REM.PST inggamana
    -gal recent past REC.PST inggamagal
    -ij middle perfect PFV inarlij
    -a future FUT oonkarla
    -j simultaneous, inceptive SIM inggamagalj

  Improvements to our grammar would be making sure that the future suffix -a is a marker limited to cooccurring with the future, imperative, or irrealis prefixes only to the tense inflection slot that takes auxiliary verbs as input. This would be done in a tense inflection slot on the main verbs.

Case
  In Bardi, case marking is phrasal; the case marker appears after the first element of the phrase. It is a type of of second position group inflection. It is consistent with other second position phenomena in the language (such as the placement of sentential clitics). According to Bowern, second position clitics pervade the clausal syntax and are important in other types of phrasal marking as well. The affixes used in Bardi are as follows:
    - Ergative -nim
    - Absolutive, Dative -ø
    - Instrumental -nga ∼ -ng

  Improvements to our case marking would have to make sure that the position is limited to the second position in the noun phrase which would be best refined in as an inflection in the irules and this is not optional and marking is required for ergative and instrumental. Also, the phonetics are involved in the instrumental cases where the morphemes would have to differ depending on final sound of the word. This needs to be handled by functions in the rules to account for the different suffixes of instrumental case marking.

Since we cannot test if any of our sentences parse, it is difficult to tell if there are any properties we illustrated that are not covered by the starter grammar or the customization system. However, one of our sentences does involve negation which I believe I disabled it in the customization as it was causing conflicts. Also, it is possible that tense and aspect do not exist in the grammar as we added the categories during customization.

We am not sure if this is necessarily an issue with the choices file or the items file but we believe that the reason that all of our sentences didn't parse has to do with one of them. It is possible that the items file didn't properly import sentences to be analyzed by the grammar or the grammar is incorrectly set up to analyze the sentences. One thing in particular that we noticed was that some inflections were added via i-rules but these prefixes/suffixes were being analyzed as separate words. So the sentences wouldn't parse because it couldn't find the words in the lexicon and the i-rules didn't get applied because there weren't any inflections on the root. To us, this means that either the inflections need to be added into the lexicon (which would defeat the purpose of the i-rules), or the way that the sentences are fed into testsuite is incorrect (which seems more likely), or some part of the grammar is messed up (also seems likely).
