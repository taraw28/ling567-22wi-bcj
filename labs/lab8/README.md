All three sentences parse with bcj-download-og grammar. Need to merge that grammar with our lab7 grammar. (has been merged, need to double check merge was done correctly by testing the sentences above)

From canvas discussion:
```
Us: "In the first tree, the V is formed from the SUBJ-HEAD rule and the S is formed from the BASIC-HEAD-OPT-COMP rule. In the second tree, the VP is formed from the BASIC-HEAD-OPT-COMP rule and the S is formed from the SUBJ-HEAD rule. The second one is the correct one."

Emily: "Doesn't have anything to do with the lexical rules, but rather only concerns the  phrase structure rules. Does Bardi have free word order? If so, then we can't say that subj-head requires COMPS < > on the head daughter. One option would be to say that basic-head-opt-comp requires [ SUBJ cons ] on the head daughter. That will probably work for now, but would block this rule from allowing dropped complements of things that don't take subjects."
