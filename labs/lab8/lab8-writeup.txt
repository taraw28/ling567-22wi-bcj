Pronouns, PNG
  Explanation
    In Bardi, personal pronoun subject and objects are affixed to the verb and agree in person, number, and/or tense.
    Subjects
      If there is an overt subject, there must be a prefix on the verb that agrees in person and number (pernum) with that subject and agrees in tense with the verb. If there is no overt subject, that pernum prefix gives the pernum information about the subject pronoun. The list of pernum prefixes, with their respective tenses, are as follows:

        Past/Present (Non-future) Tense:
          2min: mi-
          2aug: goo-
          3min, 3aug: i-
        Future Tense:
          2min (transitive): a-
          2min (intransitive): nga-
          2aug: a-
          3min, 3aug: oo-
        No Tense Distinction:
          1min: ng(a)-
          1aug: a-
          1+2min a-

      For example,

        Nganangoorribi iila.
        nga-na-ngoorribi iila
        1-TR-chase dog
        `I chase the dog.'

        Minangoorribi iila.
        mi-na-ngoorribi iila
        2MIN.PRS-TR-chase dog
        `You chase the dog.'
