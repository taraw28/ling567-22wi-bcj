## Morphology
- sentence to parse : i-ny-jarrmi-n gool-nim
- Attempt 1
  - intrans (abs) verb25: jarrmi
  - rem pc78 (non-oblig): -n
  - pst pc79 (non-oblig): ny-
  - third-person pc80 (non-oblig): i-
  - couldn't parse
- Attempt 2
  - intrans (unspcf) verb25: jarrmi
  - rem pc78 (non-oblig): -n
  - pst pc79 (non-oblig): ny-
  - third-person pc80 (non-oblig): i-
  - couldn't parse
- Attempt 3
  - intrans (abs) verb25: jarrmi
  - rem pc78 (oblig): -n
  - pst pc79 (oblig): ny-
  - third-person pc80 (oblig): i-
  - couldn't parse
    - no parse chart for full sentence but parse chart if remove i-
- Attempt 4
  - intrans (abs) verb25: jarrmi
  - rem pc78 (oblig): -n
  - pst pc79 (oblig): ny-
  - third-person pc80 (oblig): i- (removed pernum feature)
  - couldn't parse
    - parse chart for full sentence
    - unified vp and np and realized it wasn't parsing due to
      mismatched cases which is CORRECT BECAUSE IT'S AN
      UNGRAMMATICAL SENTENCE
    - could parse i-ny-jarrmi-n gool
- new sentence to parse: i-ny-jarrmi-n gool
- Attempt 5
  - intrans (abs) verb25: jarrmi
  - rem pc78 (oblig): -n
  - pst pc79 (oblig): ny-
  - third-person pc80 (oblig): i- (added pernum feature back)
  - couldn't parse
    - I think it has issues with pernum: 3rd
- Attempt 6
  - intrans (abs) verb25: jarrmi
  - rem pc78 (oblig): -n
  - pst pc79 (oblig): ny-
  - third-person pc80 (oblig): i- (changed to pernum 3min,3aug)
  - couldn't parse
    - still think the issue has to do with adding the pernum feature
    - doesn't even show part of the parse chart for the verb
- Attempt 7
  - intrans (abs) verb25: jarrmi
  - rem pc78 (oblig): -n
  - pst pc79 (oblig): ny-
  - third-person pc80 (oblig): i- (pernum 3min,3aug; changed to
    specified on subject)
  - it parsed!!!!
    - correctly parses i-ny-jarrmi-n gool
    - correctly fails to parse i-ny-jarrmi-n gool-nim
- replaced pst pc with more general tense pc
  - added more past tense affixes
  - added future tense
    - added sentence to testsuite (will test after adding tv verbs)
      ```
      Anggarramarra.
      a-ngg-arr-a-marra
      1-FUT-AUG-TR-cook
      `We will cook it.'
      ```
  - added present tense (null marked)
- replaced third-person pc with more general pernum pc
  - added 1min, 2min, 3min, 1+2min prefixes
    - still parses i-ny-jarrmi-n gool
    - still correctly doesn't parse i-ny-jarrmi-n gool-nim
  - added 1aug, 2aug, 3aug
    - added aug pc
    - added aug feature to aug pc
    - added constraint to aug pernums that aug pc is required
    - added sentence to testsuite
      ```
      Inyarrjarrmin gool.
      i-ny-arr-jarrmi-n gool
      3-PST-AUG-get.up-REM.PST father.ABS
      `The fathers got up.'
      ```
    - still parses old sentences
- added 2 transitive (tr) pc (tr-min and tr-aug)
  - added min feature to tr-min and aug feature to tr-aug to make sure that pernum prefixes are not in conflict with the different tr markers
  - test sentence
    ```
    Aambanim aarli inamanyana.
    Aamba-nim aarli i-na-ma-nya-na
    man-ERG fish.ABS 3-TR-PST-catch-REM.PST
    `The man caught the fish.'
    ```
  - still parses old sentences
  - parses new sentence too!
- replaced rem pc with more general aspect pc
  - added cont, rem-pst, rec-pst, pfv, and fut aspects (note, fut is
    not an aspect but sometimes takes the same slot as the aspects
    which is why it is included here)
  - still parses old sentences
- removed bad verb types and verb pc
- added new verb types
  - it: abs subj
  - it: erg subj
  - tr: erg subj abs obj
  - tr: erg subj all obj
  - it-preverb
  - tr-preverb
  - light verb
- removed gender
  - bardi doesn't have gender; MIN is often glosses as M
- got rid of auxiliaries
- added personal pronouns
  - 1 more sentence in our testsuite parses!!!

## How Verbs Work
- all verbal predicates: verb inflect for prefixes, suffixes, and clitics
- complex predicates: uninflecting preverb that precedes the root
  ```
  (Preverb) Prefixes-ROOT-Suffixes=Clitics
  ```
- inflecting verbs
  - required
    - person prefix
    - marked for tense
  - optional
    - transitivity
      - min: tr morphene before tense
      - aug: tr morpheme after aug marker
    - tense
    - aspect
    - applicatives
    - reflexive/reciprocal derivation
  - order
    - person-tense-augment
- preverb
  - controls transitivity (pp 514)
- case
  - tr erg subj abs obj (most common)
  - tr erg subj all obj
  - it abs subj (most common)
  - it erg subj

## MMT
### First Translation
2. First sentence parsed with 1 reading; it generated 1 sentence and the transfer did 4 successful unifies and 2 failed ones
3. Some of them didn't generate a sentence, some of them did. Some showed transfer or parser output. The last one was really interesting. It translated from eng to sje and then back to eng and actually got the sentence it started with.
4. Had to remove ex-det := extracted-det-phrase. line from rules.tdl to get it to compile.
6. Compiled with no issue
8. First translation attempts:
  Attempt 1: Did not work because, since we use aarli "fish" instead of "car", we needed to change the pred from _fish_n_rel to _car_n_rel.
  Attempt 2: Getting "this does not appear to be a grammar image." error. Posted to Canvas
