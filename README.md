  - added cont, rem, rec, pfv, sim aspects
- Neg
  - unchecked neg auxiliary verb
- Lexicon
  - removed neg from auxiliaries

## Lab 2 Phenomena
### Case
### Tense/aspect

## Lab 3 Phenomena
### Determiners/rest of NP
- no official distinction between NP and DP (pp. 327) but...
  - 3rd person pronouns are quite extensively used as determiners + modifiers of nouns (pp. 286)
  - no documentation of this so would be difficult to implement
- choices files lists 2 dets: jarri and barni and says order is det-noun
  - jarri = this
  - barni = around/when/tell/this
    - this case on pp. 717/772
- could do this and there's only two of them so wouldn't be too difficult
- nvm found a section on demonstratives

### Argument optionality
- subject and object can be inflected on the verb; don't think that counts as this though
- don't think bardi has this; not 100% sure

### Coordination
- coudld do this
- has word for and "agal" which is used monosyndetically
  - can be used under scope of negation
  - can conjoin elements in verbless clauses (not much about them)
  - used in giving choices
- has word for also "biila" which is used for "both...and" constructions
- can chain agal for phrases but not clauses
  - for clauses, use parataxis

### Agreement
- entirety of chapter 10 is about agreement
- should definitely tackle this

I think we should do determiners, coordination, and agreement

## Lab 3
4 things to do:
  - phenomena 1
  - phenomena 2
  - phenomena 3
  - morphotactics
we could split it (one person does 2 phenemona and the other does 1 phenomenon and morphotactics)
or split phenomena and work on morphotactics together (agreement is probably a more time-consuming phenomena than determiners/coordination)
